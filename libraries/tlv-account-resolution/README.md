# TLV Account Resolution

Library defining a generic state interface to encode additional required accounts
for an instruction, using Type-Length-Value structures.

## Example usage

If you want to encode the additional required accounts for your instruction
into a TLV entry in an account, you can do the following:

```rust
use {
    domichain_program::{account_info::AccountInfo, instruction::{AccountMeta, Instruction}, pubkey::Pubkey},
    spl_discriminator::{ArrayDiscriminator, SplDiscriminate},
    spl_tlv_account_resolution::state::ExtraAccountMetas,
};

struct MyInstruction;
impl SplDiscriminate for MyInstruction {
    // For ease of use, give it the same discriminator as its instruction definition
    const SPL_DISCRIMINATOR: ArrayDiscriminator = ArrayDiscriminator::new([1; ArrayDiscriminator::LENGTH]);
}

// Actually put it in the additional required account keys and signer / writable
let extra_metas = [
    AccountMeta::new(Pubkey::new_unique(), false),
    AccountMeta::new(Pubkey::new_unique(), true),
    AccountMeta::new_readonly(Pubkey::new_unique(), true),
    AccountMeta::new_readonly(Pubkey::new_unique(), false),
];

// Assume that this buffer is actually account data, already allocated to `account_size`
let account_size = ExtraAccountMetas::size_of(extra_metas.len()).unwrap();
let mut buffer = vec![0; account_size];

// Initialize the structure for your instruction
ExtraAccountMetas::init_with_account_metas::<MyInstruction>(&mut buffer, &extra_metas).unwrap();

// Off-chain, you can add the additional accounts directly from the account data
let program_id = Pubkey::new_unique();
let mut instruction = Instruction::new_with_bytes(program_id, &[], vec![]);
ExtraAccountMetas::add_to_instruction::<MyInstruction>(&mut instruction, &buffer).unwrap();

// On-chain, you can add the additional accounts *and* account infos
let mut cpi_instruction = Instruction::new_with_bytes(program_id, &[], vec![]);

// Include all of the well-known required account infos here first
let mut cpi_account_infos = vec![]; 

// Provide all "remaining_account_infos" that are *not* part of any other known interface
let remaining_account_infos = &[]; 
ExtraAccountMetas::add_to_cpi_instruction::<MyInstruction>(
    &mut cpi_instruction,
    &mut cpi_account_infos,
    &buffer,
    &remaining_account_infos,
).unwrap();
```

For ease of use on-chain, `ExtraAccountMetas::init_with_account_infos` is also
provided to initialize directly from a set of given accounts.

## Motivation

The Solana account model presents unique challeneges for program interfaces.
Since it's impossible to load additional accounts on-chain, if a program requires
additional accounts to properly implement an instruction, there's no clear way
for clients to fetch these accounts.

There are two main ways to fetch additional accounts, dynamically through program
simulation, or statically by fetching account data. This library implements
additional account resolution statically. You can find more information about
dynamic account resolution in the Appendix.

### Static Account Resolution

It's possible for programs to write the additional required account infos
into account data, so that on-chain and off-chain clients simply need to read
the data to figure out the additional required accounts.

Rather than exposing this data dynamically through program execution, this method
uses static account data.

For example, let's imagine there's a `Transferable` interface, along with a
`transfer` instruction. Some programs that implement `transfer` may need more
accounts than just the ones defined in the interface. How does a an on-chain or
off-chain client figure out the additional required accounts?

The "static" approach requires programs to write the extra required accounts to
an account defined at a given address. This could be directly in the `mint`, or
some address derivable from the mint address.

Off-chain, a client must fetch this additional account and read its data to find
out the additional required accounts, and then include them in the instruction.

On-chain, a program must have access to "remaining account infos" containing the
special account and all other required accounts to properly create the CPI
instruction and give the correct account infos.

This approach could also be called a "state interface".

## How it works

This library uses `spl-type-length-value` to read and write required instruction
accounts from account data.

Interface instructions must have an 8-byte discriminator, so that the exposed
`ExtraAccountMetas` type can use the instruction discriminator as a `ArrayDiscriminator`.

This can be confusing. Typically, a type implements `SplDiscriminate`, so that
the type can be written into TLV data. In this case, `ExtraAccountMetas` is
generic over `SplDiscriminate`, meaning that a program can write many different instances of
`ExtraAccountMetas` into one account, using different `ArrayDiscriminator`s.

Also, it's reusing an instruction discriminator as a TLV discriminator. For example,
if the `transfer` instruction has a discriminator of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`,
then the account uses a TLV discriminator of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` to denote
where the additional account metas are stored.

This isn't required, but makes it easier for clients to find the additional
required accounts for an instruction.

## Appendix

### Dynamic Account Resolution

To expose the additional accounts required, instruction interfaces can include
supplemental instructions to return the required accounts.

For example, in the `Transferable` interface example, along with a `transfer`
instruction, also requires implementations to expose a
`get_additional_accounts_for_transfer` instruction.

In the program implementation, this instruction writes the additional accounts
into return data, making it easy for on-chain and off-chain clients to consume.
